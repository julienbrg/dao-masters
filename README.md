# DAO Masters

## Intro

The *daoists* of [DAO Masters](mainnet.aragon.org/#/daomasters) help communities to launch DAOs for:

* Federations of orgs
* Groups of activists
* Local communities
* Commons to maintain

[DAO Masters](mainnet.aragon.org/#/daomasters) is deployed on Ethereum at the following address:

[0x3d273d60E04B43668c32b9c1e049B99210Ab8B3F](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d273d60E04B43668c32b9c1e049B99210Ab8B3F)

Its ENS redirection address is:

[daomasters.eth](https://manager.ens.domains/name/daomasters.eth)

To be enacted, a proposal requires a 50% support and a 20% quorum. Vote duration is set to 2 weeks.

We accept donations in ETH or DAI.

If you need an invoice, please send an Etherscan reference to [invoice@daomasters.fund](mailto:invoice@daomasters.fund).

## Rules

The *daoists* (members of DAO Masters) get one right of vote in DAO Masters when they join.

To get an additional right of vote, a daoist must help a community to deploy a DAO and to deliver a first successful proposal.

A 'successful proposal' is an action on the ground that shows an obvious positive social impact, preferably even before it's submitted.

A *daoist* with five rights of vote becomes a DAO Master.

Currently there aren’t any DAO Master because no one owns five rights of vote.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: init

1. Identify the most relevant projects.
2. Educate on the crypto thing (Metamask config, on-chain voting, …).
3. Gather the members’ Ethereum addresses.
4. Help deploy on Ethereum.
5. Make an initial symbolic donation.

### Phase 2: run

1. Help the future beneficiaries to gather proofs of their first action.
2. Invite them to talk about their action.
3. Accompany them in the proposal submission process.
4. Advise on how to transfer DAI to local currency.
5. Help this community to set a fundraising strategy.
